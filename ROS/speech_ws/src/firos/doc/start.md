# Start Guide

This documentation aims to give as much information as possible to give an overview, how FIROS is working and on how to
setup an own FIROS-Instance.

To install FIROS, visit [this Install Guide](install/install.md). There is a
[Turtlesim-Example](install/turtlesim-example.md) which describes how FIROS is interacting with a Context-Broker and a
`rosnode`.
