FIROS is a tool that helps connecting robots to the cloud. For this purpose it uses the
[Robot Operating System (ROS)](http://www.ros.org/) and the
[FIWARE Context Broker](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion) as a way to publish and listen robot's data. FIROS
is not limited to only publish data onto the Context-Broker. Developers can easily implement other standards which can
be used along with the Context-Broker if wished.

FIROS works as a translator between the robotics field and the cloud world, transforming ROS messages into FIWARE to
publish them in the cloud, and vice versa.
