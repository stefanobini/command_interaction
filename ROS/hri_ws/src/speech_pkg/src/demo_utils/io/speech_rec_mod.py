        """
        Records a single phrase from ``source`` (an ``AudioSource`` instance) into an ``AudioData`` instance, which it returns.
        This is done by waiting until the audio has an energy above ``recognizer_instance.energy_threshold`` (the user has started speaking), and then recording until it encounters ``recognizer_instance.pause_threshold`` seconds of non-speaking or there is no more audio input. The ending silence is not included.
        The ``timeout`` parameter is the maximum number of seconds that this will wait for a phrase to start before giving up and throwing an ``speech_recognition.WaitTimeoutError`` exception. If ``timeout`` is ``None``, there will be no wait timeout.
        The ``phrase_time_limit`` parameter is the maximum number of seconds that this will allow a phrase to continue before stopping and returning the part of the phrase processed before the time limit was reached. The resulting audio will be the phrase cut off at the time limit. If ``phrase_timeout`` is ``None``, there will be no phrase time limit.
        The ``snowboy_configuration`` parameter allows integration with `Snowboy <https://snowboy.kitt.ai/>`__, an offline, high-accuracy, power-efficient hotword recognition engine. When used, this function will pause until Snowboy detects a hotword, after which it will unpause. This parameter should either be ``None`` to turn off Snowboy support, or a tuple of the form ``(SNOWBOY_LOCATION, LIST_OF_HOT_WORD_FILES)``, where ``SNOWBOY_LOCATION`` is the path to the Snowboy root directory, and ``LIST_OF_HOT_WORD_FILES`` is a list of paths to Snowboy hotword configuration files (`*.pmdl` or `*.umdl` format).
        This operation will always complete within ``timeout + phrase_timeout`` seconds if both are numbers, either by returning the audio data, or by raising a ``speech_recognition.WaitTimeoutError`` exception.
