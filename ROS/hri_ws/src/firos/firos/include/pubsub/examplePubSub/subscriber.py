            the same name as the subfolder this File is in.

            Here goes the Subscription Routine
            This Routine needs to make sure it that it be called somehow from an extern Signal

            make sure to handle incoming Context-Broker-Queries

            You need to make in this Routine sure (it is only called ONCE, but can be called multiple times), 
            that you have some mechanism, which calls the described function below!
