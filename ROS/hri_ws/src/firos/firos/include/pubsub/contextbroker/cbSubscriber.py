            This method only gets called once (or multiple times, if we get a reset!)! So we need to make sure, that in this file
            'RosTopicHandler.publish' is called somehow independently after some Signal arrived (from elsewhere).

            Keep in mind that Firos can get a Reset-Signal, in this case, this method is called again. Make sure that this method can get called 
            multiple times!

            In this Context-Broker-Subscriber we spawn ONE HTTP-Base-Server in another Thread, which will be used, 
            so that the Context-Broker can notify us after it received a Message. 

            In addition to that, the Context-Broker needs to know how to notify us. This is solved by adding subscriptions into 
            the Context-Broker, which we need to manually maintain. Again we start a Thread for each Topic which handles the Subscriptions



            So After everything is set up, Firos can be notified, explicitly here the method:
            """CBServer.CBHandler.do_post""" is invoked by Notification. This method handles the Conversion back into a conform "ROS-Message".

            After we did the Conversion, we simply need to call  """RosTopicHandler.publish"""
